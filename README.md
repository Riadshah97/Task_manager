### VIRTUAL ENVIROMENT
Setting up environment variables in a Django project is a common practice to manage configuration settings that may vary between environments (e.g., development, staging, production). Here's how you can set up environment variables and use them in a Django project:

If you don't have virtualenv installed, you can install it using pip:
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
source venv/bin/activate

You can use these variables anywhere in your Django project as you would use regular Python variables
With this setup, you can easily manage your configuration settings, and you won't need to hardcode sensitive information or environment-specific configurations in your code.
